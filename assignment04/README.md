# Assignment 04 - PHPrison

---

Create a series (3 or more not counting escape page) of pages.  Each page will present the user with some kind of puzzle.  Puzzle answers can be entered into a form. Use POST.

If they give you a wrong answer...stay on page and heckle them.

Don't allow them to reach any of the pages without answering the question on the previous page.

Have a sweet escape/win page.  Don't allow them to get to this page without solving all the challenges.

Provide spoiler info in an HTML comment.
